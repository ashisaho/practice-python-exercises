# Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. For practice, write this code inside a function.

# Concepts to practice
# Lists and properties of lists
# List comprehensions (maybe)
# Functions

originalList = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]

def listEnds(firstList, endsList)
endsList = [firstList[0], firstList[-1]]
print (endsList)
